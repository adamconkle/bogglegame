My First Boggle Game

This is my first Javascript project based on one of my favorite games to play.  

How to play:
Press the "Mix it up" button to randomize the letters.
Use the letters to form as many words as you can.
You can go any direction including diagonally, but each letter has to be adjacent to the next letter in the word. 
Earn Points: 3-letter words (1 point), 4-letter words (2 points), 5-letter words (3 points), 6-letter words (4 points)
